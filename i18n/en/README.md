<summary><strong>🧬 Glue Coding</strong></summary>

> **The Holy Grail and Silver Bullet of Software Engineering**

Glue Coding is the ultimate evolution of Vibe Coding, potentially solving three fatal flaws:

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| 🎭 AI Hallucination | ✅ Only use verified mature code, zero hallucination |
| 🧩 Complexity Explosion | ✅ Every module is a battle-tested wheel |
| 🎓 High Barrier | ✅ You only need to describe "how to connect" |

**Core Philosophy**: Copy instead of write, connect instead of create, reuse instead of reinvent.

<summary><strong>🎨 Canvas Whiteboard-Driven Development</strong></summary>

> **A New Paradigm for Visual AI Collaboration**

Traditional development: Code → Verbal communication → Mental architecture → Code out of control

Canvas approach: **Code ⇄ Whiteboard ⇄ AI ⇄ Human**, whiteboard becomes the single source of truth

| Pain Point | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| 🤖 AI can't understand project structure | ✅ AI directly reads whiteboard JSON, instantly understands architecture |
| 🧠 Humans can't remember complex dependencies | ✅ Clear connections, one glance shows all impacts |
| 💬 Team collaboration relies on verbal communication | ✅ Point at the whiteboard to explain, newcomers understand in 5 minutes |

**Core Philosophy**: Graphics are first-class citizens, code is the serialized form of the whiteboard.

<summary><strong>🐝 AI Swarm Collaboration</strong></summary>

> **Multi-AI Agent Collaboration System Based on tmux**

Traditional mode: Human ←→ AI₁, Human ←→ AI₂, Human ←→ AI₃ (Human is the bottleneck)

Swarm mode: **Human → AI₁ ←→ AI₂ ←→ AI₃** (AI autonomous collaboration)

| Capability | Implementation | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🔍 Perception | `capture-pane` | Read any terminal content |
| 🎮 Control | `send-keys` | Send keystrokes to any terminal |
| 🤝 Coordination | Shared state files | Task synchronization and division |

**Core Breakthrough**: AI is no longer isolated, but a cluster that can perceive, communicate, and control each other.

<summary><strong>🔮 Philosophy & Methodology Toolbox</strong></summary>

> **Systematize Vibe into verifiable, iterable, and convergent engineering output**

23 philosophical methodologies + Python tools + copy-paste prompts, covering:

| Method | Use Case |
|:---|:---|
| Phenomenological Reduction | When requirements are vague, clear assumptions and return to observable facts |
| Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis | Rapid prototype → Counter-examples → Converge to engineering version |
| Falsificationism | Use tests to reveal failure modes |
| Occam's Razor | Remove unnecessary complexity |
| Bayesian Update | Dynamically adjust beliefs based on new evidence |

**Core Philosophy**: Philosophy is not empty talk, it's actionable engineering methodology.

## 🖼️ Overview

**Vibe Coding** is the ultimate workflow for AI pair programming, designed to help developers smoothly bring ideas to life. This guide details the entire process from project conception, technology selection, implementation planning to specific development, debugging, and expansion. It emphasizes **planning-driven** and **modularization** as the core, preventing AI from going out of control and leading to project chaos.

> **Core Philosophy**: *Planning is everything.* Be cautious about letting AI autonomously plan, otherwise your codebase will become an unmanageable mess.

**Note**: The following experience sharing is not universally applicable. Please adopt it dialectically in specific practices combined with your scenario.

<details open>
<summary><strong>🔑 Meta-Methodology</strong></summary>

The core of this philosophy is to build an AI system capable of **self-optimization**. Its recursive nature can be broken down into the following steps:

> Further reading: [A Formalization of Recursive Self-Optimizing Generative Systems](../zh/documents/00-基础指南/A%20Formalization%20of%20Recursive%20Self-Optimizing%20Generative%20Systems.md)

#### 1. Define Core Roles:

*   **α-Prompt (Generator)**: A "parent" prompt whose sole responsibility is to **generate** other prompts or skills.
*   **Ω-Prompt (Optimizer)**: Another "parent" prompt whose sole responsibility is to **optimize** other prompts or skills.

#### 2. Describe the Recursive Lifecycle:

1.  **Bootstrap**:
    *   Use AI to generate initial versions (v1) of `α-Prompt` and `Ω-Prompt`.

2.  **Self-Correction & Evolution**:
    *   Use `Ω-Prompt (v1)` to **optimize** `α-Prompt (v1)`, thereby obtaining a more powerful `α-Prompt (v2)`.

3.  **Generation**:
    *   Use the **evolved** `α-Prompt (v2)` to generate all required target prompts and skills.

4.  **Recursive Loop**:
    *   Feed the newly generated, more powerful products (including new versions of `Ω-Prompt`) back into the system, again for optimizing `α-Prompt`, thereby initiating continuous evolution.

#### 3. Ultimate Goal:

Through this continuous **recursive optimization loop**, the system achieves **self-transcendence** in each iteration, infinitely approaching the preset **expected state**.

<summary><strong>🧭 Methodology Essence (Dao · Fa · Shu)</strong></summary>

## 🧭 The Way (Dao)

* **If AI can do it, don't do it manually**
* **Ask AI everything**
* **Purpose-driven: All actions in the development process revolve around "purpose"**
* **Context is the primary element of Vibe Coding; garbage in, garbage out**
* **Systemic thinking: entities, links, functions/purposes, three dimensions**
* **Data and functions are everything in programming**
* **Input, process, output describe the entire process**
* **Frequently ask AI: What is it? Why? How to do it? (Golden Circle Rule)**
* **Structure first, then code; always plan the framework well, otherwise technical debt will be endless**
* **Occam's Razor: Do not add code if unnecessary**
* **Pareto Principle: Focus on the important 20%**
* **Reverse thinking: First clarify your requirements, then build code reversely from requirements**
* **Repeat, try multiple times, if it really doesn't work, open a new window**
* **Focus, extreme focus can penetrate code; do one thing at a time (except for divine beings)**


## 🧩 The Method (Fa)

* **One-sentence goal + non-goals**
* **Orthogonality (scenario-dependent)**
* **Copy, don't write: don't reinvent the wheel, first ask AI if there's a suitable repository, download and modify it (glue coding new paradigm)**
* **Always read the official documentation; first crawl the official documentation and feed it to AI (let AI find tools to download locally)**
* **Split modules by responsibility**
* **Interfaces first, implementation later**
* **Change only one module at a time**
* **Documentation is context, not an afterthought**

## 🛠️ The Techniques (Shu)

* Clearly state: **What can be changed, what cannot be changed**
* Debug only provide: **Expected vs. Actual + Minimum Reproduction**
* Testing can be handed over to AI, **assertions human-reviewed**
* Too much code, **switch sessions**
* **AI mistakes should be organized into experience using prompts for persistent storage; when encountering unsolvable problems, let AI search this collected issues and find solutions**

## 📺 Demo and Output

In one sentence: Vibe Coding = **Planning-driven + Context-fixed + AI Pair Execution**, transforming "idea to maintainable code" into an auditable pipeline, rather than an uniteratable monolith.

**What you will get**
- A systematic prompt toolchain: `i18n/zh/prompts/01-系统提示词/` defines AI behavioral boundaries, `i18n/zh/prompts/02-编程提示词/` provides full-link scripts for demand clarification, planning, and execution.
- Closed-loop delivery path: Requirement → Context document → Implementation plan → Step-by-step implementation → Self-testing → Progress recording, fully reviewable and transferable.

<summary>📈 Performance Benchmarks (Optional)</summary>

This repository is positioned as a "workflow and prompts" library rather than a performance-oriented codebase. It is recommended to track the following observable metrics (currently primarily relying on manual recording, which can be scored/marked in `progress.md`):

| Metric | Meaning | Current Status/Suggestion |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Prompt Hit Rate | Proportion of generations that meet acceptance criteria on the first try | To be recorded; mark 0/1 after each task in progress.md |
| Turnaround Time | Time required from requirement to first runnable version | Mark timestamps during screen recording, or use CLI timer to track |
| Change Reproducibility | Whether context/progress/backup is updated synchronously | Manual update; add git tags/snapshots to backup scripts |
| Routine Coverage | Presence of minimum runnable examples/tests | Recommend keeping README + test cases for each example project |

## 🎯 Original Repository Translation

> The following content is translated from the original repository [EnzeD/vibe-coding](https://github.com/EnzeD/vibe-coding)

To start Vibe Coding, you only need one of the following two tools:
- **Claude Opus 4.5**, used in Claude Code
- **gpt-5.1-codex.1-codex (xhigh)**, used in Codex CLI

This guide applies to both the CLI terminal version and the VSCode extension version (both Codex and Claude Code have extensions, and their interfaces are updated).

*(Note: Earlier versions of this guide used **Grok 3**, later switched to **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and now we are using **Claude 4.5** (or **gpt-5.1-codex.1-codex (xhigh)**))*

*(Note 2: If you want to use Cursor, please check version [1.1](https://github.com/EnzeD/vibe-coding/tree/1.1.1) of this guide, but we believe it is currently less powerful than Codex CLI or Claude Code)*

---

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Full Setup Process</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Game Design Document</strong></summary>

- Hand your game idea to **gpt-5.1-codex** or **Claude Opus 4.5** to generate a concise **Game Design Document** in Markdown format, named `game-design-document.md`.
- Review and refine it yourself to ensure it aligns with your vision. It can be very basic initially; the goal is to provide AI with the game structure and intent context. Do not over-design; it will be iterated later.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Tech Stack and <code>CLAUDE.md</code> / <code>Agents.md</code></strong></summary>

- Ask **gpt-5.1-codex** or **Claude Opus 4.5** to recommend the most suitable tech stack for your game (e.g., ThreeJS + WebSocket for a multiplayer 3D game), save it as `tech-stack.md`.
  - Ask it to propose the **simplest yet most robust** tech stack.
- Open **Claude Code** or **Codex CLI** in your terminal and use the `/init` command. It will read the two `.md` files you've created and generate a set of rules to guide the large model correctly.
- **Key: Always review the generated rules.** Ensure the rules emphasize **modularization** (multiple files) and prohibit **monolithic files**. You may need to manually modify or supplement the rules.
  - **Extremely Important:** Some rules must be set to **"Always"** to force AI to read them before generating any code. For example, add the following rules and mark them as "Always":
    > ```
    > # Important Note:
    > # Before writing any code, you must fully read memory-bank/@architecture.md (including full database structure).
    > # Before writing any code, you must fully read memory-bank/@game-design-document.md.
    > # After completing a major feature or milestone, you must update memory-bank/@architecture.md.
    > ```
  - Other (non-Always) rules should guide AI to follow best practices for your tech stack (e.g., networking, state management).
  - *If you want the cleanest code and most optimized project, this entire set of rule settings is mandatory.*
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Implementation Plan</strong></summary>

- Provide the following to **gpt-5.1-codex** or **Claude Opus 4.5**:
  - Game Design Document (`game-design-document.md`)
  - Tech Stack Recommendation (`tech-stack.md`)
- Ask it to generate a detailed **Implementation Plan** (Markdown format), containing a series of step-by-step instructions for AI developers.
  - Each step should be small and specific.
  - Each step must include tests to verify correctness.
  - Strictly no code - only write clear, specific instructions.
  - Focus on the **basic game** first; full features will be added later.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Memory Bank</strong></summary>

- Create a new project folder and open it in VSCode.
- Create a subfolder `memory-bank` in the project root.
- Place the following files into `memory-bank`:
  - `game-design-document.md`
  - `tech-stack.md`
  - `implementation-plan.md`
  - `progress.md` (create an empty file to record completed steps)
  - `architecture.md` (create an empty file to record the purpose of each file)
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Vibe Coding Develops the Basic Game</strong></summary>

Now for the most exciting part!

<details>
<summary><strong>Ensure Everything is Clear</strong></summary>

- Open **Codex** or **Claude Code** in the VSCode extension, or launch Claude Code / Codex CLI in the project terminal.
- Prompt: Read all documents in `/memory-bank`. Is `implementation-plan.md` completely clear? What questions do you have for me to clarify, so that it is 100% clear to you?
- It will usually ask 9-10 questions. After answering all of them, ask it to modify `implementation-plan.md` based on your answers to make the plan more complete.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Your First Implementation Prompt</strong></summary>

- Open **Codex** or **Claude Code** (extension or terminal).
- Prompt: Read all documents in `/memory-bank`, then execute step 1 of the implementation plan. I will be responsible for running tests. Do not start step 2 until I verify the tests pass. After verification, open `progress.md` to record what you've done for future developers' reference, and add new architectural insights to `architecture.md` explaining the purpose of each file.
- **Always** use "Ask" mode or "Plan Mode" (press `shift+tab` in Claude Code) first, and only let AI execute the step after you are satisfied.
- **Ultimate Vibe:** Install [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com) and chat casually with Claude or gpt-5.1-codex using voice, without typing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Workflow</strong></summary>

- After completing step 1:
  - Commit changes to Git (ask AI if you don't know how).
  - Start a new chat (`/new` or `/clear`).
  - Prompt: Read all files in memory-bank, read progress.md to understand previous work progress, then continue with step 2 of the implementation plan. Do not start step 3 until I verify the tests.
- Repeat this process until the entire `implementation-plan.md` is completed.
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✨ Adding Detail Features</strong></summary>

Congratulations! You've built a basic game! It might still be rough and lack features, but now you can experiment and refine it as much as you want.
- Want fog effects, post-processing, special effects, sound effects? A better plane/car/castle? A beautiful sky?
- For each major feature added, create a new `feature-implementation.md` with short steps + tests.
- Continue incremental implementation and testing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🐞 Fixing Bugs and Getting Stuck</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>General Fixes</strong></summary>

- If a prompt fails or breaks the project:
  - Use `/rewind` in Claude Code to revert; for gpt-5.1-codex, commit frequently with Git and reset when needed.
- Error handling:
  - **JavaScript errors:** Open browser console (F12), copy error, paste to AI; for visual issues, send a screenshot.
  - **Lazy solution:** Install [BrowserTools](https://browsertools.agentdesk.ai/installation) to automatically copy errors and screenshots.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Difficult Issues</strong></summary>

- Really stuck:
  - Revert to the previous git commit (`git reset`), try again with a new prompt.
- Extremely stuck:
  - Use [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com/) or [uithub](https://uithub.com/) to synthesize the entire codebase into one file, then send it to **gpt-5.1-codex or Claude** for help.

<summary><strong>💡 Tips and Tricks</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code & Codex Usage Tips</strong></summary>

- **Terminal version of Claude Code / Codex CLI:** Run in VSCode terminal to directly view diffs and feed context without leaving the workspace.
- **Claude Code's `/rewind`:** Instantly revert to a previous state when iteration goes off track.
- **Custom commands:** Create shortcuts like `/explain $param` to trigger prompts: "Analyze the code in depth to thoroughly understand how $param works. Tell me after you understand, then I will give you a new task." This allows the model to fully load context before modifying code.
- **Clean up context:** Frequently use `/clear` or `/compact` (to retain conversation history).
- **Time-saving trick (use at your own risk):** Use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` or `codex --yolo` to completely disable confirmation pop-ups.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other Useful Tips</strong></summary>

- **Small modifications:** Use gpt-5.1-codex (medium)
- **Write top-tier marketing copy:** Use Opus 4.1
- **Generate excellent 2D sprites:** Use ChatGPT + Nano Banana
- **Generate music:** Use Suno
- **Generate sound effects:** Use ElevenLabs
- **Generate videos:** Use Sora 2
- **Improve prompt effectiveness:**
  - Add a sentence: "Think slowly, no rush, it's important to strictly follow my instructions and execute perfectly. If my expression is not precise enough, please ask."
  - In Claude Code, the intensity of keywords to trigger deep thinking: `think` < `think hard` < `think harder` < `ultrathink`.

<summary><strong>❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></summary>

- **Q: I'm making an app, not a game, is the process the same?**
  - **A:** Essentially the same! Just replace GDD with PRD (Product Requirement Document). You can also quickly prototype with v0, Lovable, Bolt.new, then move the code to GitHub, and clone it locally to continue development using this guide.

- **Q: Your air combat game's plane model is amazing, but I can't make it with just one prompt!**
  - **A:** That wasn't one prompt, it was ~30 prompts + a dedicated `plane-implementation.md` file guided it. Use precise instructions like "cut space for ailerons on the wing," instead of vague instructions like "make a plane."

- **Q: Why are Claude Code or Codex CLI stronger than Cursor now?**
  - **A:** It's entirely a matter of personal preference. We emphasize that Claude Code can better leverage the power of Claude Opus 4.5, and Codex CLI can better leverage the power of gpt-5.1-codex. Cursor does not utilize either of these as well as their native terminal versions. Terminal versions can also work in any IDE, with SSH remote servers, etc., and features like custom commands, sub-agents, and hooks can significantly improve development quality and speed in the long run. Finally, even if you only have a low-tier Claude or ChatGPT subscription, it's completely sufficient.

- **Q: What if I don't know how to set up a multiplayer game server?**
  - **A:** Ask your AI.
