# AI Swarm Collaboration

> Multi AI Agent collaboration system based on tmux

## Core Concept

Traditional mode: Human ←→ AI₁, Human ←→ AI₂, Human ←→ AI₃ (Human is the bottleneck)

Swarm mode: **Human → AI₁ ←→ AI₂ ←→ AI₃** (AI autonomous collaboration)

## Capability Matrix

| Capability | Implementation | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🔍 Perception | `capture-pane` | Read any terminal content |
| 🎮 Control | `send-keys` | Send keystrokes to any terminal |
| 🤝 Coordination | Shared state files | Task synchronization and distribution |

## Core Breakthrough

AI is no longer isolated, but a cluster that can perceive, communicate, and control each other.
