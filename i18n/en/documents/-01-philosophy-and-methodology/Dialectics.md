Applying Dialectical Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis to Vibe Coding: I treat each coding session as a round of "triadic progression"

Thesis (Current State): First let the model quickly provide the "smoothest implementation" based on intuition, with only one goal: get the main path running as soon as possible

Antithesis (Audit & Tuning): Immediately take the "critic" perspective and challenge it: list failure modes/edge cases/performance and security concerns, and ground the challenges with tests, types, lint, benchmarks

Synthesis (Correction Based on Review): Combine speed with constraints: refactor interfaces, converge dependencies, complete tests and documentation, forming a more stable starting point for the next round

Practice Mantra: Write smoothly first → Then challenge → Then converge

Vibe is responsible for generating possibilities, thesis-antithesis-synthesis is responsible for turning possibilities into engineering certainties
